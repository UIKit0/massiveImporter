o Name changes:
  plugin is now called MsvTools.py (was: NimbleMsv.py)
  importer window is now launched through msvImporterWin (was nsImportMsvWin)
  importer command is now called msvImporter (was nsImportMsv)
o New install process uses the Maya module system and doesn't require setting
  your PYTHONPATH. Hopefully it's easier than the old way.
o There is now a command line tool "MsvTranslator.py" which allows you to load
  a Massive scene in "chunks" of a few hundred at a time. Each chunk is loaded
  in batch mode and then saved out as a Maya file. At the end all of the saved
  files are imported into one file and that is in turn saved out.
  This process can help work around some Maya memory leaks (memory which is
  never released even by doing a "File > New"). While the entire process will
  take longer than importing the agents all at once it can allow for a much
  larger final scene.
o Add a new way of loading simulation data. The new "loader" anim type will
  use a custom msvSimLoader node to drive the skeleton animation. The
  msvSimLoader loads animation directly from disk and does not create anim
  curves.
  Advantages: shorter the initial load time and reduced memory usage.
  Disadvantages: no anim curves means you can't edit the loaded animation.
o Geometry caching now creates one cache per frame instead of one cache per
  agent. Previously, with one cache per agent, Maya would run out of file
  descriptors once the number of agents in the scene got too large.
o Add a "RollbackImporter" (adapted from
  http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/notes/reloading.html) to allow the plugin
  to be unloaded and reloaded. Probably only useful for development.
o Bug: Geometry caching would sometimes fail because the cacheFile command
  would write out a partial dag path to disk instead of a full dag path.
  Fix: query what was actually written out to disk before making the
  attachFile call.
o Print a warning instead of a "divide by zero" exception if the wrong sim type
  is specified.

o Option to cache smooth skinned agents using Maya's geometry cache. This can
  significantly reduce the amount of memory required to load a Massive sim...
  but also significantly increases the time required to load it.

===
o ns_vars.so plug-in is no longer needed. Callsheets are used instead.
  o Allows the importer to work even when Ready-to-Run agents are present.
o Can import all agents in a scene, or only those in the specified 'selections'.
o Chunk Skinning - geometry is chopped into pieces and each chunk is
  parented to a joint. Definitely not final quality, but takes a lot less
  memory than smooth skinning and can give a better idea of the final result
  than segments.

o Previously an agent's scale_var would also scale its animation data,
  yielding an incorrect sim. This has been fixed.
o Support option nodes that don't have a name, geometry nodes that don't
  have any geometry, and weights files that don't exist
