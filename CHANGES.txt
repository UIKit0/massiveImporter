o Option to cache smooth skinned agents using Maya's geometry cache. This can
  significantly reduce the amount of memory required to load a Massive sim...
  but also significantly increases the time required to load it.

o ns_vars.so plug-in is no longer needed. Callsheets are used instead.
  o Allows the importer to work even when Ready-to-Run agents are present.
o Can import all agents in a scene, or only those in the specified 'selections'.
o Chunk Skinning - geometry is chopped into pieces and each chunk is
  parented to a joint. Definitely not final quality, but takes a lot less
  memory than smooth skinning and can give a better idea of the final result
  than segments.

o Previously an agent's scale_var would also scale its animation data,
  yielding an incorrect sim. This has been fixed.
o Support option nodes that don't have a name, geometry nodes that don't
  have any geometry, and weights files that don't exist

o Fix some path bugs to allow plug-in to work on windows
