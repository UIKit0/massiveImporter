Installation Instructions for NimbleMsv: A Massive Importer for Maya

Note: Currently this plug-in is only supported for Maya 8.5 and up

You ready? It's a bit hairy...

1. The Massive Importer package should contain:
   NimbleMsv.py
   ns/
   nsImportMsvWin.mel

2. NimbleMsv.py is the Maya plug-in, move it into your Maya plug-in path

   Linux Example:
   mv NimbleMsv.py ~/maya/8.5/plug-ins

3. ns/ is a directory structure containing the byte-compiled python scripts
   used by NimbleMsv.py, move it into your PYTHONPATH

   Linux Example: (assuming your PYTHONPATH contains the directory /my/python/path/)
   mv ns /my/python/path/

4. nsImportMsvWin.mel is the Maya UI for the importer, move it into your
   Maya script path

   Linux Example:
   mv nsImportMsvWin.mel ~/maya/8.5/scripts
