1. Extract MsvTools042.zip or MsvTools042.tgz to the directory of your choice

2. Open MsvTools.txt in a text editor and change PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
   to point to the MsvTools directory.

   Ex (Windows):
   If C:/MyExtraPlugins/MsvTools contains the extracted icons/, plug-ins/,
   scripts/, and python/ directories, edit MsvTools.txt to look like:

+ MsvTools 0.4.2 C:/MyExtraPlugins/MsvTools

   Ex (Linux):
   If /opt/MsvTools contains the extracted icons/, plug-ins/, scripts/,
   and python/ directories, edit MsvTools.txt to look like:

+ MsvTools 0.4.2 /opt/MsvTools

3. Copy MsvTools.txt into the 'modules' directory found either in your
   your local Maya preferences directory or in the Maya installation directory.

   On Windows, for Maya 2008, this is by default: 
   C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\My Documents\maya\2008\modules
   or
   C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\modules

   On Linux, for Maya 2008, this is by default: 
   ~<username>/maya/2008/modules/
   or
   /usr/autodesk/maya2008/modules/
   
   If the modules directory does not exist, create it.
   
4. In order to use the MsvTranslator.py standalone python script you'll have to
   set your PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the 'python' directory.
   Since the MsvTranslator.py python script is not launched from Maya setting
   the PYTHONPATH in your Maya.env file will not work - it must be set through
   the normal process for your operating system.
   
   Ex (Windows):
   If C:/MyExtraPlugins/MsvTools contains the extracted python/ directory, add
   C:/MyExtraPlugins/MsvTools/python
   to your PYTHONPATH. On Windows the PYTHONPATH can be set by:
   1. RMB on My Computer
   2. Go to Properties > Advanced
   3. Click "Environment Variables"
   4. Click "New"
   5. Enter "PYTHONPATH" for the Variable name
   6. Enter the path to the 'python' directory for the Variable value
   7. Click OK
   8. Click OK
   9. Click OK
   
   Ex (Linux):
   
   If /opt/MsvTools contains the extracted python/ directory
   directories add:
   /opt/MsvTools/python
   to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

5. Launch Maya and load the "MsvTools.py" plugin from the Plug-in Manager.
